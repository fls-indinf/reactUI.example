# Example react UI

This example application demonstrates using the [reactUI](https://github.com/sibvisions/reactUI) as external library. The application will add custom screens and will use other external libraries to demonstrate the full power.

# Dev Setup
- run `npm link` in your reactUI directory
- run `npm link reactUI` in your reactUI.example directory
- run `npm link ../reactUI/node_modules/react` in your reactUI.example directory to prevent react collision errors
